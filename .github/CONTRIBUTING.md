# How to Contribute to GHAdmin

We would love to have some help filling this out, but in short our policy can be summed up with this -

* Did you find a bug? Open an Issue!
  * Ensure that the bug hasn't already been reported
* Did you write some code and want to submit it?
  * Create a Pull Request!
* Did you want to have a discussion about how a feature is implemented or the rationale behind it? Open an Issue!

## Thank You!

Your contributions to open source, large or small, make projects like this possible. Thank you so much for spending time improving this PowerShell module!
